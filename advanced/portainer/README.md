# Portainer

[Portainer](https://portainer.io) is a nice web-UI for managing containers on docker hosts and also kubernetes.

You can try to install it on your local machine using their [docs](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install/server/docker/linux), there are no concrete instructions for this.
Let us know if you have a working UI to manage your containers ;)
